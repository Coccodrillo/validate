# gosexy/validation

The `gosexy/validation` package applies a set of validation rules on
user-provided data, this data could be from any source, including web forms or
web-based API parameters.

## Installation

```sh
go get -u menteslibres.net/gosexy/validate
```

## Usage

Import the validation package.

```go
import "menteslibres.net/gosexy/validate"
```

Use validation functions to make sure the user is providing a valid e-mail
address. See the full list of validation rules in the [docs][1].

```go
userEmail := "user@example.com"
err := validate.Email(userEmail)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("This is not an e-mail!")
}
```

Note that many validations can be applied at once on the same user input using
`validate.Chain()`.

```go
err := validate.Chain(userEmail, validate.NotEmpty, validate.Email)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("This is not an e-mail!")
}
log.Printf("Got an e-mail address.")
```

Any function of the form `func(string) error` can be used along with
`validate.Chain()`, so you can add custom validations.

```go
fnCustomValidation = function(s string) error {
  // Some validation
  return nil
}
err := validate.Chain(userEmail, validate.NotEmpty, validate.Email, fnCustomValidation)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("This is not an e-mail!")
}
log.Printf("Got an e-mail address.")
```

If you need to check many rules use `validate.Each()` and pass some `error`
values, the first `error` value found will be returned.

```go
firstErr := validate.Each(
  validate.Email(userEmail),
  validate.NotEmpty(userName),
)
if firstErr == nil {
  // Data is clean!
}
```

The function `validate.All()` makes sure all validations are tested, it returns
an array of errors (`[]error{}`) with the failed tests. Useful for checking
all user inputs at once.

```go
errs := validate.All(
  validate.Email(userEmail),
  validate.NotEmpty(userName),
)
```

Another useful function is `validate.Any()`, will return `nil` if any of the
rules return `nil`.

```go
err := validate.Any(userAge, validate.Empty, validate.Integer)
if err == nil {
  // Value is empty or an e-mail.
}
```
